# Struck-online-GEOG676-fall2025
Overview

This lab demonstrates how to use ArcPy to automate a GIS workflow in ArcGIS Pro.
We work with garage coordinates (garages.csv) and the campus building dataset (Structures in Campus.gdb) to:

Import garage locations from a CSV file.

Create a file geodatabase and copy campus structures into it.

Buffer garages by a specified distance (150 meters in this case).

Intersect the buffers with structures to identify nearby buildings.

Export the results table to CSV for further analysis.

Repository Contents

lab4.py → Python script containing the full ArcPy workflow.

Homework04.gdb → File geodatabase generated by the script. Includes:

Garages_WGS84 (original CSV points in WGS84)

Garages (projected to campus CRS)

Structures (copy of input)

Garages_Buffer_150m (garage buffers)

Intersect_150m (intersection result)

Intersection_150m.csv → Exported table of intersected garages + structures.

README.md → This documentation file.

Requirements

ArcGIS Pro with ArcPy installed

garages.csv (garage coordinates in WGS84)

Campus.gdb (provided dataset with TAMU structures)

Usage
